Whenever we think of Mexican cuisine, the first thing which comes to our mind is taco. Though the authentic taco is mainly made of meat (especially beef and pork), but if you are a vegetarian, here is something for you. 
Refried beans are basically beans which are boiled, mashed and then fried or baked. Its name is a direct translation from the Spanish word ‘frijoles refritos’ meaning well-fried beans (and not fried-again). It is a staple dish of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine. Mostly it is made up of pinto beans (chitra rajma), black beans or red kidney beans (rajma). It can be had in many ways; as a filling in tacos, as a dip with nachos or in any dish where you want a vegetarian substitute of keema. 
So here is my take on this delicious recipe for you:-

<span style="font-weight:bold">INGREDIENTS</span>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>1 cup red kidney beans</li><li>4 tbsp oil (preferably olive oil)</li><li>1 onion (big) chopped</li><li>1 tomato (big)</li><li>2-3 chillies chopped</li><li>3-4 cloves of garlic chopped</li><li>3 tsp taco seasoning</li><li>½ tsp roasted cumin powder</li><li>2 tsp chilli powder (or according to your taste)</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li>2 cups of water</li>
</ul>     

<span style="font-weight:bold">PROCEDURE</span>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Soak the red kidney beans in water overnight to make them tender.</li>
  <li>Cook the soaked kidney beans with 1 tsp of salt in pressure cooker till the beans are properly cooked. Drain out the beans and keep rest of the water for later.</li>
  <li>Blanch the tomato, peel it and blend it in a mixer-grinder till smooth puree. Keep it aside.</li>
  <li>In a pan, heat the oil. Add the chopped garlic and onion and cook till the onion becomes light golden brown.</li>
  <li>Add chopped chillies, tomato puree, taco seasoning, cumin powder and chilli powder. Cook all of it for 2-3 minutes on medium heat.</li>
  <li>Add the drained out cooked red kidney beans. Cook it for another 3-4 minutes till it starts becoming little dry. Add salt according to your taste. (Do taste the beans before adding salt since the taco seasoning also contains some salt.)</li>
  <li>Mash the beans with back of a spoon or with potato masher till you get the desired texture (you can keep it chunky or smooth to your liking). Alternatively, you can use food processor for blending the beans to the desired texture.</li>
  <li>Add the leftover water little by little (need not to use all of it) into the mashed beans and cook the beans for 4-6 minutes on medium-low heat till it gets a little thick consistency. And you have your refried beans ready.</li>
  <li>You can garnish it with coriander leaves or cheese, if you want.</li>
</ul>

Do try out this recipe. Even if you are not a big fan of rajma (yes, we do exist), you would surely love this.
