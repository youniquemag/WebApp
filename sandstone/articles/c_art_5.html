.                    Just about 8 o’ clock the other night, while silently minding my own business, I couldn’t help being intrigued by the juvenile avidity of a group of about twelve children. They were battling their lungs out, over a game of football. It was in a park on the Southern Avenue.

                     The children seemed to be from a nearby slum, about 9-10 years of age. Frantically running up and down the dusty field, without any shoes on their feet, they looked for every opportunity to score. The two young goalkeepers- messy hair, dirty hands, observed the game from their positions and were quick in their reflexes to do their job. What seemed more mesmerizing was that there was a little girl who was equally sweating it out with the boys in the dirt, with her spirit and will higher than ever. Ironically, it was the goal from her feet, which sealed it for her team. Take that, stereotypes!

                     “Ki re? Kara jitli? Arr koto goal dili?” If you ask this to any one of them, they’ll look at you with a wide smile on their face and a sparkle in their eyes. Of course, you’ll be answered, with much enthusiasm.

                     To these children, life is all about waking up everyday and gathering for a good time over a game in the evening and laughing it off over a chat on their way home. But amidst this carefree, breezy and non-chalant way of going about their lives, they do take this game seriously. Apart from that, no worries. Any sort of interaction with a random spectator of their game adds to their happiness. Yes, that’s what the minimal recognition means to them. They always look forward to their only time of solace through the course of their day – the battle within those hundred yards.
