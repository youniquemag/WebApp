15?th?? ?August,? ?2017

Today marks the 70th year of independence of our motherland. A country that has reached great heights and is capable of so much more. Yes, we strive for excellence but, is this the country we really want to live in? A country where 63 babies died in a hospital due to the lack of oxygen, and the doctor who ordered oxygen with his own money to save their lives was fired by the hospital management?! Or a country where fake pictures were propagated on social media to enhance the level of communal riots going on in a state?

India is my country and all Indians are my brothers and sisters, yet we hear that women are raped in our country almost every day. If we actually respect our women then why are these cases on the rise? And most surprisingly, these cases involve juveniles. Is this what we really want to teach our forthcoming generation? And since our country is still struggling to treat our women right, the two questions we should never ask are, “ kitne mein aati hai?” and “Kitna deti hai?” The women, however aren’t behind at all. With mostly pseudo feminists looming up in every nook and cranny, men are having a tough time everywhere. Feminism talks about equality but all these pseudo feminists care about is their superiority over men.

We are proud of our rich heritage but the monuments in our country are littered with names and various other scribbles etched on their walls. We Indians want to immortalize ourselves with the monuments we have but what we don’t realize is that we are actually destroying the very heritage that we’re so proud of.

We are the world’s fastest growing economy and ironically, everything is our country is treated like a business. From healthcare to education, everything in our country is a way to extract money from the common masses. With the recent demonetization that happened, this ill-planned smart move, instead of benefitting the country, actually caused a lot of hardships for the common folk. If recovering black money was so important, why is Vijay Mallya still outside the country? All we are obsessed about is a four-legged domestic animal and who’s eating what (specially who’s eating that four-legged animal). On this day, when India turns 70, let’s all take an oath to make our nation great again. Let’s not be obsessed with what one should eat and what one shouldn’t. Instead, let us choose a government which
would take our country to greater heights and not cause communal tension in our country. I know many of us still choose to not cast our vote but please understand that every single vote counts. Many of us choose to stay out of politics but being apolitical in a democracy, is a crime.

Yes, this letter is very vague. It talks about a lot of things and nothing at all in the same time. But let me just ask you one question. Even after 70 long years of independence, are we really free?

Yours faithfully,
A concerned citizen.
