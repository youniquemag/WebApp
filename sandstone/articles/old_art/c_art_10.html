On a chilly winter night, both of them stood on a lonely lane of the city under the starry sky of the night. They did not know each other. Their eyes met, but immediately, they looked away. Rather, it was a sense of guilt or shame in their eyes which they did not want to share with the world. 

One was waiting for some warmth from a roadside shelter or bonfire, while the other was waiting to ignite the fire of passion for someone else. They are known by the names Bhikhu bhikhari and Bijli, the prostitute. Nobody knew their real names, nobody cared. 

Every night, Bhikhu comes to this part of the lane in search of leftover food that people might have thrown away, or to scavenge through the dustbins of the shops in the area. For Bijli, this is her regular pickup point where she waits for her clients. 

But, tonight, Bhikhu wanted to say something, but the time was not right. He decided to wait. 

They were not always like this. Bhikhu was once Bikash, who came to the city with dreams to find a job to support his family. He started with some odd jobs, but bad company and addicted doomed him. Soon, he ended up behind the bars for petty thefts and earned a bad name for himself. Bikash turned into a beggar, Bhikhu due to lack of jobs when he came out of jail. He regrets every moment of his life when he lost sight of his true focus. He has not contacted his family since and he doesn’t know what happened to them.

On the other hand, Bimala came to the city holding the hands of his lover, eloping from home with dreams of a new life, a new morning. But, that dream just lasted for a week. Her lover sold her to a brothel and took off with the money. Bimala turned into Bijli and her bright mornings turned into painful nights. Night after night, she started losing herself, and finally she accepted her fate. She has not contacted her family since and she doesn’t know what happened to them.

Every night, Bijli stood on the dark lanes to be picked up, and Bhikhu would look at her for sometime, and when she is gone, he would go back to his work. Bhikhu has never seen Bijli smile.

Tonight was no different either, but tonight was going to be different. It was really chilly and the lanes were not so dark either. It was Christmas and the streets were lit by dazzling light and shimmering decorations. They saw each other.

Soon, Bijli left in a car, and Bhikhu went back to his usual scavenging. The night was getting colder. Bhikhu was happy to find an old rag to keep him warm tonight. He was waiting for Bijli, but she was later than her usual time. After a long time, Bhikhu lost hope. 

As he was preparing to sleep off, the blazing lights of a passing car almost blinded him. The car screeched into a halt, the door opened, something was thrown on the road, and it rode away faster. He could hear them cheering and abuse as the car moved away. 

Bhikhu came coming to find an almost half naked, Bijli on the road, her face bruised badly. She was barely able to get up. Bhikhu helped her get up. He had never seen her like this, she was always so beautiful with all that makeup. Her eyes were tearful with a thousand stories to tell. 

Bijli brushed him away, but she fell again without his support. Bhikhu wrapped the rag around her and helped her again. This time, Bijli did not resist. He helped her to the side of the road where there was a small bonfire, he knew that she was in pain.

He gave her water and she accepted. Her eyes looked numb. Bhikhu ran and brought a small packet from where he was sleeping and gave Bijli. She was hesitant in the beginning, but then accepted. She opened the box to find a small piece of cake in it. Bhikhu took the plastic spoon inside and scooped up a bit and offered Bijli. Bhikhu had spent his entire day’s earning on this cake. She looked at him, almost devoid of emotion after what she had gone through.

She took the bite, and tears rolled down her eyes, once again. But, this time they had a warmth in them. Bhikhu spoke up, “I want something in return.”

Bijli’s heart sank. Just when she was about to enjoy a slice of life, an exchange was offered. She felt rotten from within, thinking what Bhikhu will ask for in return. What else can men ask for from a woman like her? What else can she give?

Suddenly, Bhikhu said, “I want to spend the night with you.” There was a look of disgust on Bijli’s face. Bhikhu understood her concern. He added, “Please don’t get me wrong. I want to take you to the church at midnight. You will feel happy there. You will smile. Father said if I can bring smile on anyone’s face tonight, the person will smile always. And, I have never seen you smile, so I want to take you there and make you smile. You will look beautiful with a smile.”

The words were too intense for Bijli. She was numb once again. Again, her eyes became tearful. 

Bhikhu felt uncomfortable. He said, “Please don’t cry. I am sorry if you felt bad.” He was about to get up and leave when Bijli held his hand and said, “I will spend the night with you.” And smiled. 

Then, she offered a spoon of the cake to him. They both smiled. On Christmas Eve, the tunes of Christmas carols from a distant church marked the beginning of a new relationship and an exchange of trust. 

On this chilly winter night, the warmth of friendship kept both of them warm.
