Summer’s here. And in India, most of the households will be busy with pickling raw mangoes with a whole mix of different spices. I love these tangy and aromatic pickles. If you are also a lover of pickles, I am sure you would love this recipe of Achari Chicken too. A famous North Indian dish, it consists of cooking chicken in tangy gravy with pickling spices. So let’s take a look at the recipe.

<span style="font-weight:bold">PROCEDURE</span>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Add the mustard oil to a hot pan. (If you don’t like mustard oil, you may use any other vegetable oil; though mustard oil will give you the best results.)</li>
  <li>Once the oil starts to smoke up, add the onion seeds, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, fennel seeds and crushed coriander seeds. Let the spices splutter.</li>
  <li>Add chopped onions to it and sauté till the onions are translucent. Add ginger and garlic paste and cook for 1-2 minutes on a medium to medium-high flame.</li>
  <li>Add the chopped tomatoes to it and cook till the tomatoes become soft.</li>
  <li>Add the chicken pieces. Cook everything until the chicken pieces aren’t pink.</li>
  <li>Add turmeric powder, red chilli powder and Kashmiri red chilli powder. Stir for a minute.</li>
  <li>Lower the flame and add the hung curd. (Mix about 1 tsp of gram flour to well beaten hung curd to prevent the curd from splitting.) Mix everything well.</li>
  <li>Add salt and sugar. Cook it covered over a medium flame for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add julienned ginger pieces and cook it covered for another 5-7 minutes or until the chicken gets cooked thoroughly. (If you feel that the gravy is drying up, add little warm water to it while cooking.) Your Achari Chicken is ready.</li>
  <li>For garnishing:-
Slit some green chillies half the way. Mix the chaat masala with little water to form a paste. Stuff the slit green chillies with this chaat masala paste and fry them in a small pan. Garnish the Achari Chicken with chopped coriander leaves and fried tangy green chillies.</li>
</ul>
