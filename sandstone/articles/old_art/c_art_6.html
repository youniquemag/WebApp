Everyone is apparently considered an equal by law but it is very easy to deprive a girl from everything by just telling her that you are a woman and you cannot do a particular thing. According to most people a man is capable of doing anything that he wants to do but a woman is always portrayed as delicate and weak as compared to men. Before a woman was not given a chance to prove herself in any field and so it was presumed that she is just a piece of beauty who men can show off around but now the scenario is completely different as women has proved that they are an important part of the society which was dominated by men previously. There are certain examples of such women like Malala Yousafzai who became popular after she was tried to kill because she wanted the girls in Pakistan to attain education, even after all these years a girl in some countries still struggle to get basic education which she deserves, then there is Coco Chanel who is a daughter of a laundry woman and now one of the top fashion designers of this world. These examples prove that there is nothing that a woman cannot do if given a chance. A successful woman is the who builds her empire with the stones thrown on her. We just have to look around and we will find million women who have shown that they have the power of doing anything that they want in spite of any kind of opposition that they face.
