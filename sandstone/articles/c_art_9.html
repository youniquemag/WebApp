5 years in Mangalore introduced me to such a different array of cuisine which I had never tried before. Mangalorean cuisine mainly comprises of dishes from the Tulu Nadu region (Udupi-Mangalore-Kasargod) and is quite unique.
Today I am sharing the recipe of one of the famous Mangalorean dishes (and one of my favourites), chicken ghee roast with neer dosa. Chicken ghee roast, being spicy and little heavy, goes perfectly with light and spongy neer dosa. (A match made in heaven.)
So let’s see how to cook this delicious combo.

<span style="font-weight:bold; text-decoration: underline;">NEER DOSA</span>

<span style="font-weight:bold">INGREDIENTS
</span><ul style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>1 cup of rice</li><li>1/4th cup coconut</li><li>5 cups of water</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li>Oil</li>
</ul>     

<span style="font-weight:bold">PROCEDURE</span>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Soak the rice in 1 cup of water for 2 hours.</li>
  <li>After 2 hours, blend the soaked rice with coconut into a smooth paste. (Peel the brown skin off the coconut before using.)</li>
  <li>Add about 4 cups of water into the paste to make it into pouring consistency.</li>
  <li>Add salt to taste.</li>
  <li>Take a non-stick dosa tawa (if not, use regular non-stick tawa) and put it on medium-high flame.</li> 
  <li>Take some paper napkins, dip them into little bit of oil and grease the tawa nicely.</li>
  <li>When the tawa becomes hot enough (You can check it by splashing a little bit of water on the tawa. If it splatters then the tawa is hot enough.), pour in a ladle of the dosa batter onto the tawa (Do mix the batter nicely every time before pouring it onto the tawa) and spread the batter nicely over the entire circumference. The dosa need to be porous, having little holes in it.</li> 
  <li>Cook until the sides of the dosa start separating from the tawa and the centre isn’t sticky. You need not cook it on the other side.</li>
  <li>Fold the dosa into quarters and carefully remove it onto a plate. Your neer dosa is ready.</li>
</ul>
