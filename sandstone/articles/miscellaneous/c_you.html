You.
In poetic ways, some would say you're a breath of fresh air. You're like a summoning of something positive, a feeling. You are the most intense emotion I've ever felt. You are the unstoppable force that moved my immovable soul.
You.
You make me nervous. You make me tense. You make me want to curse everything around me that distances me from you. I dream about you. You make me want to erase everyone around us when you are in front of me. You make me scared.
You.
You make me feel like the birds in the sky, swaying away with the strong winds under the dark looming clouds. You make me feel free, you make me feel alive. I sway around, letting the winds take me wherever they want to, because I can bet my life on them. I feel like I've been released after so long. But I also know what these strong winds mean. I know these dark clouds are threatening to burst open with torrential rain and wash everything away. Everything including my freedom.
I will not be able trust these winds anymore because they will get brutal. They will push me into dark corners, and try their best to trap me. You make me scared.
I will not be able to stretch my wings anymore, because the cruel rain will drench them and burden them with rainwater. My wings will get heavy and pull me down. You make me nervous.
I will not find these low rumblings in the faraway clouds musical anymore. They will come closer, flash right in front of me eyes, and blind me. You make me tense.
You.
You are the storm that will make me crash and burn. You are the rain that will make me drown. You are the lightning that will stop my heart. And I will have no regrets.
Because by the time the storm comes, I will have known how my heart feels when it is pounding in my ears. I will have known how it feels to be able to spread my wings and trust the winds. I will have known how the fearsome thunders can also sound majestic and beautiful. I will have known how to lose myself in the dark clouds and feel no fear.
I will have known myself.
I will have known you.
And I couldn't have asked for more.
