Firstly, take comfort in knowing that one of the ways you can fight back against mosquitoes, gnats, flies, no-see-ums and other pesky bugs doesn’t have to involve covering yourself with a sticky spray or engaging in chemical warfare. To help you enjoy going outdoors, try strategically placing insect-repelling plants in your garden, balcony or inside your house.
Here I’ve presented my take on five ornamental plants that can help keep plant attacking insects at bay.
Basil:
It repels flies and mosquitoes. It can be planted near the doors or at the places where you tend to relax. Fresh Basil can also be used to make insect repelling spray. The recipe is simple. Add 4 to 6 ounces of Basil to a container with boiling water, letting the leaves steep for several hours, and then removing the leaves and squeezing out all of the leaves. Then mix it with vodka and store in a refrigerator and use it as a spray.
Lavender:
It repels moths, fleas, flies and mosquitoes. Lavender fragrance at home has been used for centuries. People love the smell but certain insects don’t. It can be planted in the sunny areas of the garden and near the entryways to keep the house area pest free. It can also be tied as a bouquet and kept inside the house to keep flies away. The oil extracted from lavender can also be used a mosquito repellent. The lavender oil nourishes the skin and gives a calming effect which can help you sleep.
Lemongrass:
It mainly repels mosquitos. Citronella, a natural oil which is found in lemongrass and is an ornamental plant which can grow up to to 4 feet tall and 3 feet wide in one season. Many Asian dishes are also made with lemongrass. It adds fragrance to certain chicken and pork recipes.
Lemon thyme:
Repels mosquitos. The best quality of this herb is that it can adapt to dry or rocky, shallow soil and will thrive in your garden. The plant itself won’t repel mosquitos. To use it you have to first bruise the leaves. To do this, just cut off the stems and rub them between your hands. Before doing that make sure that your tolerance is enough to not be affected by the plant's chemicals. Just rub the crushed leaves on a small area of your forearm.
Mint:
The most common herb and it mostly grows in pots. It repels mosquitoes. Besides, the leaves can also be used to flavour minty drinks. The aromatic properties are found in the leaves and stems. Containers of mint strategically placed in the garden or on the patio will help keep nearby plants insect free.
