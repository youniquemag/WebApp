Yesterday marked the 70 th anniversary of your country. Your country, that was once a part of ours’ or rather, once our countries co-existed mutually as one. Yet today, we are nothing but bitter rivals. And our rivalry runs so deep that no other rivalry can ever match up to it. However, is this bitterness really necessary? Is it really this necessary that we fight over a piece of land? Why can we not co-exist together like we used to once upon a time? A time when both of our countries prospered. Our countries could do so much better if we worked together.

Honestly, with all due respect to your government, your leaders have lead your country in a downward spiral. A path which spelt nothing but destruction of your country. Think about it, your country was the world’s first ever Islamic republic. Think about the pride your country might have had. But your leaders; yes, your leaders let that all go to waste. What they left behind in your country is a declining GDP, and terrorists. Yes, it’s known in plain sight. Your country has nothing else other than terrorism. Pakistan needs to ask for monetary help from the International Monetary Fund almost every year. Do you not see where this constant rivalry is getting you? Instead of competing with India, why don’t you not work on building your own infrastructure? Why don’t you focus on making your nation great again? You see, rivalry gets us nowhere. As Mahatma Gandhi rightly said, “an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.” The point is, this rivalry with us is making your country weaker by every second. No I’m not a Pakistani, I’m an Indian but you’d probably hate me for saying all this. However, keeping in mind the history of the whole subcontinent, no one needs to remind us about how prosperous our countries were before the partition. Why do you think the British broke us apart in the first place?

Moving on, let’s not even get started on the terrorism issue. After the Reagan Doctrine, your country, like a few others became very influential when it came to the Mujahedeen. Your very own intelligence agency admitted recruiting individuals for the acts of terrorism, and so did one of your ex-prime ministers. Even though you receive financial help from the United States of America, it gets you nowhere, because all you are concerned about is trying to get back at India regarding the Kashmir issue. Instead of funding terrorists, why not use that money in training your people at sports? Honestly, the Pakistani cricket team was one of the best teams out there but now they are nothing. No one regards them as a challenge as they used to before.

I know this letter is very naïve, and it’s meant to be so. This letter is written on a very emotional perspective. I know everyone who reads this would probably feel that this letter is childish. I know that
this wouldn’t make any difference either. But why not try to exist mutually without any issues, without any violence and without any rivalry? Why can’t our rivalry just exist on the cricket pitch?

We have had enough of this rivalry. Let’s just not drag it any further.

A human being.
