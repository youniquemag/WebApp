<div  style="text-align: center">

Kissed your butt ... Ah! Such pleasure!
Stubbed, stamped, burned out ...
May be anger, love or leisure.
A cuppa for my hand on the left,
You are my right hand man!
I will burn you down ... and pick up one again.

I don't know if it's your tale or mine
A tale to tell and so of time
Twin, may be, you are to me?
May be we are one ...
Consuming each other ...
 ... till death do us part.
