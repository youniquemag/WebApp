Under the obscured moonlight,
Clouded vision,nothing in sight.
Left only with traces of remembrance,
While my ears ring with the eutony of her name.

Consumed by the fires of passion,
Left burned and bruised,
Too cliched ,just following fashion.
Yet she seemed all too amused.

Plethora of words,covering acts of deceit.
Fear flowed through her veins exposing her might.
Stooped down to save it all from its decrepit remains,
while Only shallow words throbbed out from her realms.

She sought to redeem herself,
Only to satisy her cynical conscience.
As on the next day I was none but a shadow of my former self,
A shadow filling her mind with fake luminescence.

So she set out on her halcyon days,
While I hold onto past memories.
For memories are meant to be cherished,
As she is now ,from my world, will remain banished.
