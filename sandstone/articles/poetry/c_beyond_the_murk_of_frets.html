It lurks in corners, hidden from wild eyes,
But the wise are aware where its presence lies.
I saw its form for the first ever time,
When fear had held me and my words wouldn't rhyme.
There was cold; and a nasty blindness
Where a rattling echoed amidst the darkness.
Then, I saw it appear and glide towards me,
Heading to make me the last of my family tree.

My eyes couldn't shape out a face,
With a raspy breath, it quickened its pace;
And spread its wings as majestic as an angel.
Thanatos drew near, a maddening ring of wild knell.

This faceless beauty was such a drug!
It enriched my sorrow and I wished my grave was dug.
Haywired nerves caused chaos in my brain.
I welcomed peace so that all my fever would drain.
The devil gripped my sense: What a tough life it is!
You strive so hard but loss snatches all that therein is.
As I let it touch me, I found myself withering
For the scenes of departed time passed before me shivering.

I noticed, winking from the shades were the auras of dawn,
The reasons I could live for, the hope of mine long gone.
They locked their fingers and barricaded my way ...
Their swollen, misty eyes begged for me to stay.
Deep, deep down, I felt the heat swell
I fathomed the pain in which my beloveds would dwell.
So, like a receding river, I took a step back
To retrieve my sword; ready to fight for the light that was lack.

It paused advancing; the despair it fed on was gone,
Although the dancing ghosts and bloody rivers wished to linger on.
A tentative sigh of light came drifting in
Right when Death backed out from securing another win.
