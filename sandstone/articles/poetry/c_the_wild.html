Among the horses bred under a shed,
Born to be tamed,
One will always be, or two;
Born far from the wild,
Yet with the wild within.
Flogged and whipped on iron skin,
The wild will never die,
The wild will call.
Stable doors will break,
And every fence will fall
When to the beast the wild will call.
