The time has come to step out of the light,
We shall be standing at the cross roads.
The mask worn on our faces for over a decade,
It shall crumble and fade away.
Will the demon inside take over our minds ?

All these years dancing to each others beat,
Setting new curves on everyone faces.
Holding on to each other for so long,
Till the day comes,where memories only remain.(or shall it?)

Time shall be our judge,
Whether we can grasp on to our emotions,
Or let our demons plague our mind.
And kick each other into the world of oblivion.

Shall we be the victim of one's forgetfullness?
The debt we owe to each other,
Shall it be paid by blissful ignorance?
So,let us plant the seed of Hope and Time shall answer.
