With my roots,
Dug deep into the earth
I see others past me,
To reap what they sow.
Birds fly away,
To sing a song,
Of their melancholy.

Under my shades lies,
An unknown travesty.
The change of seasons ,
Tearing the veins inside me.
As the leaves wither .
And soon frost embraces me,
As winter beckons.
Yet hoping for Spring to come over.

The blooming flowers,
Appears bright ,
Through the dark of the night.
Alligned to form a wreath.
The moon casts out its light
Piercing the grey landscape.
Yet these tired boughs reach out,
For the moon.

As the sharp winds blow against me ,
The fruits crashes into despair .
Soon there's no fruit to cherish.
The boughs lay contorted and empty,
Yet new leaves grow from the fragments remaining,
When birds greets the day with their song,
Helios showers its rays,
And welcomes the dawn of new life.
