My Corpse

If my corpse lies still
With a smile on its face,
Be happy for me…
It won’t erase.

If you see me frowning or sad,
Don’t you worry…life wasn’t so bad!
Just sit by me and feel my hair,
I will know that you were there.

But if you are all far away…
Just tell me you love me,
I will hear you say.
