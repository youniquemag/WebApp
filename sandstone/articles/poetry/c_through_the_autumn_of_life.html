Death came passing by,
Whispered me a tale,
Of Life Beyond.
Through the pale mist,
I sought the light
Which grew dim with every step.

A promise made to me ,
To seal the wounds that Life made.
The warmth slowly faded,
As I succumbed to his charms.
But the touch of frost,
Ignited the Life inside.

I could hear Reason lamenting,
Her voice echoed through the plains of oblivion:
"Death only answers the Craven's Cry"
She led me astray from the path that beset.
And Realization delved deep into my mind,
Of Death's impending transgression.

Turned my back away,
To follow Her voice,
Through the Autumn of Life,
Where Salvation might lie.
Or wither away ,
In the Sands Of Time.

Life waited inside,
While Apathy greeted.
Death left unhurriedly.
And left a rose behind,
To be remembered,
When nothing shall remain.
