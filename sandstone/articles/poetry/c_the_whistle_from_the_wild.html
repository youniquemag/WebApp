<div  style="text-align: center">

The dual strands of the twisted emotions
The rust in the blood of fearless nations ...
Candles burn brighter to rain some light
But in the end the darkness bites!

The single mother feeds her child,
When the dog meets the wolves from the wild ...
The rustling whistle of yellow trees
Can thee shackled passions ever break free?

The tight clenched fist
The riders from the mist
Hope still screams
And love still breathes

</div>
