The sledge hits the snow so white
Little children smiling so bright
Mother cuddles her child so tight
Though winter's chilly ... cold doesn't bite.

Ask what you want ...
The Santa comes.
Stockings get heavy
All joy ... in rush.
But you sick pathetic creatures of the farm ...
Eating more than you'll ever earn
You've more stockings to hang than to fill.
Still seeing your life in a reel?

The poison spreads as these creatures flaunt
A little kid wonders ...
What does Santa Want?
