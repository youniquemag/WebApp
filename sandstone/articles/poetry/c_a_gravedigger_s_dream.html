A life of solitude,
Icicles in my brain.
Yearning for the long lost warmth,
Yet Winter touches my soul.

Years pass by,
Digging homes of lost souls.
Seeing them transcend into a better world,
While I keep on waiting for my turn.

Struck by an epiphany,
To revive myself.
Mind contorted between guilt and pleasure,
Yet I seek the forbidden touch.

Knocking on the homes of the lost,
In search for the perfect one.
Sought the one my heart yearned,
Ecstatic ,I was ,like a child.

The ravens sang,
The owls stared.
The rotten piece of tranquility,
Seemed so perfect and serene.

No questions asked,
Just like I want it.
All under my spell,
As I proved my dominance.

Fed my manlihood,
As I struck deep with every thrust.
I could feel my blood boiling,
All the warmth coming back.

The peak has reached,
As I planted my seed.
Overjoyed ,being accepted at last.
But alas , it was temporary euphoria.

Epiphany crept in ,
The eutony of guilt ringing in my ears.
Crawled back into my little hole,
Contemplating what to do with myself.

Kept the door of her home open,
Letting her see the moonlit sky.
Letting some life into her,
Or did I overperform ?
