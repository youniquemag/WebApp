<div  style="text-align: center">

Man walks on earth in the pitiful shade of God's grace,
Where the earth embers with the fires of hate.
The tyrant above looks down upon man's travesty,
with a sense of overwhelming majesty!
Contempt fills the crack you made,
While others bow to your knees for it to be unmade.
Showering your forces of darkness,
Which we fools harness!
Sending shepherds to lead Lamb to the slaughter,
Here I stand to be your mocker!
With flickering hope, you lead the nation
In reality you rot inside of mortification.
