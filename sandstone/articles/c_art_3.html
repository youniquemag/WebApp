ANTI-TERRORIST SQUAD, DELHI, INDIA
</span>

It has been a very busy day for the entire department. The national holidays always remain as one of the target days for the terrorists as they want to spread terror on the very day India got independent, so that people can never get used to a normal peaceful life.

The officials have been hustling around, seeking threads of any information whatsoever, regarding the possible threats for the next day. But, there were no positive findings yet.

Just when things were looking good for the 71st Independence Day, Mr. Arvind Kumar, an Indian intelligence specialist, made his way to the director's office, as swiftly as he could.

"Sir, I have received information from an anonymous source, that there are chances of possible terror attacks in two metro stations in the vicinity of Rashtrapati Bhawan. I am afraid we might need to shut down the stations, and increase security as much as we can.'

There was no evident tension in the director's face, about this recent development. He had already faced similar situations over a hundred times in his career of 20 years, where he has been lauded time and again, for saving the nation from the worst possible threats.

He calmly gave the required directions to Arvind, "Do the needful. Inform the Defence squad, and the Delhi Police. But we can't shut down the metro, unless and until we have some concrete proof. It will anyway raise the suspicion and might alert the terrorist group."

"But, Sir, the source is a reliable one. I have the blueprints of the attack. And it's all conclusive of the fact that, there will be some development in the Udyog Bhawan and Central Secretariat Metro, as it will be densely populated tomorrow on the eve of the Independence Day celebrations.", Arvind argued.

"Fine, I will go through the blueprints and inform the departments. I need a full dedicated team to follow this thread, and try to extract every possible detail related to this attack. Our target is to stop them before they can even imagine that we can. Evacuation is our last option. We don't want to create a panic in the mass, unless and until we have run out of all the options." The director sounded serious this time, for blueprints were something he didn't expect, at such an early stage.

"Right away Sir. I will assemble the team in the functioning square, as soon as possible."

As he was going out of the cabin, his hand stopped at the door knob. Something was still left to be informed, he wondered, but should he?

"Is there anything more you need to say?", asked the director, judging his body-language.

"I don't know if it's important sir, but the source I received, I tried to localize it via GPS. Usually, we don't find anything, as the sources are highly encrypted. But this time, I could easily breach in, it narrowed to a location in the Indian territory, around 370 kms from the capital, up north. If not suspicion, it leaves me with curiosity."

The director's face looked grim. This was a situation he hated, for reasons he can't tell anyone.

It was his last shift, as Dr.Rajeev Mishra swiftly moved out of the emergency surgery ward. It has been a long tiring day, as there have been several trauma cases in the last 24 hrs. He was really looking forward to a holiday, as he walked towards his car.
As he turned the engine on, the radio sprang into life, with patriotic songs flooding in. He smiled for a moment, realizing what is left of 15th august, after 70 years of independence? Just a holiday, or a phase of shopping offers or more? "I wish, it would have rather been an ordinary day, at least it would have got the respect it deserved", he wondered.

It was a peaceful ride back home. The night was dark, yet filled with anticipation of spending some quality time with his family.

Out of a sudden, the songs broadcasting from the radio stopped. There was a moment of silence.

"There has been a terror attack in two of the metro stations in the capital, near Rashtrapati Bhawan, at around 10:05 PM. There have been mass casualties but the number has not yet been ascertained by the concerened authorities yet. The patients are being transferred to the nearest government hospitals, and the defence squad is already in place. The entire capital is in red alert."

Rajeev took an u-turn as soon as possible. He could already sense the situation the hospital was about to face. He can't afford to panic or think about the consequences. Now, is the time to act, for there will be people out there who will look up to him for support. The unit must work as efficiently as possible, and they need to save as many patients as they can.

He called his wife, letting her know that he won't be able to return home anytime sooner. Well, she understands, she always did.

His phone started ringing, as he expected. It was Amish, one of the most hard working junior residents he had.

"Sir, it's already a chaos here. We have over 50 patients by now, and there are just 20 beds vacant. There are very few doctors and nurses on rounds. I am in front of the emergency OT, and I can't figure out what to do." His voice suggested that he was already in panic.

"Calm down Amish. I will be there in another 10 minutes. Don't worry, we will figure a way out."

GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL, NEW DELHI
</span>

It has been over an hour, and the emergency wards have been flooded by over thousands of patients in the last one hour. Reports suggest the death toll has crossed the 200 mark, as patients are struggling for even their last breath. The entire nation is in shock of what happened in the past one hour, which has been so profound that half of those working in the situation don't have any clue of how to cope up.

Rajeev doesn't know how the last hour has gone by in split of a second, while he has been running around the departments and OT's. As a specialist in trauma surgery, he has tried to overlook all the surgical procedures, but whatever he has been doing, was just not enough to keep up with the huge inflow of patients. That's why he was heading to an emergency meeting, which he has organized in the room adjacent to the ER, so that he can convey the needful in the minimum amount of time. Every second counted.

He started speaking as soon as everyone arrived, "We don't have much time. I know it is a chaos out there, but we need to find our way out in whichever way we can. All of you are already following the color coding for the patients, and I would request the volunteers to help the interns in this process. The nurses and the residents are already arriving, and I expect most of them will be here in an hour. We have to utilize the three OT's we have in maximum possible way, and carry out the surgeries as swiftly as they can, maintaining the basic level of precision. The burn unit is already here, but it's not possible to shift all the burn patients to their department right now, so we are taking help of other clinical departments in doing the same and providing us with ample beds.

Despite all these efforts, I know for a fact that it won't be enough. Our blood bank is going to face a huge crisis within an hour, and we won't be able to attain any more patients by the morning, as we would run out of beds. Hence, I am reaching out to the private hospitals in the area to help us with blood units, more surgical kits and accommodate the patients we won't be able to admit. But, I would ask you to do the same. Reach out to your family, friends, and ask them to come and donate blood. If you have links in local nursing home, do the same as I am trying to do, and reach out to me. The situation we are facing today can be combated, only if all of us put our best step forward. Thank you and get back to your work."

He took a breath, and proceeded towards the OT. As he was scrubbing in, an intern came running to him. "Sir, we are running out of our medicine supplies. The patients are bleeding out, what do we do?"

"Take my wallet from my office, and give a list of everything you need to one of the ward boys. Ask him to get it from a nearest medicine shop. We don"t have time to wait for the government supplies right now."

As the night went by, the situation got worse. Though there were patients who fought through, but the loss the capital was suffering from, couldn't be requited in any possible way.

What a long night it has been! Everyone was tired and exhausted, but the emergency was far from being over. Just when things were appearing to get sorted, the oxygen supply in the hospital reached a severely low level. Rajeev was thus pulled out from his 10th surgery in a row, as he was the only one in the position who could do something.

He went back to his office, to make some necessary calls. To his surprise, his wife was there waiting for him. He ran up to her, and got some comfort after hours of trauma that had managed to hit everyone, including the doctors.

"When did you get here?" he asked her.

"Around an hour ago. I wanted to come and help, but the children didn't let me go last night. They were so afraid of the terror all around. So, I made my way down as soon as I could in the morning."

He wondered, "The terror has shaken everyone to their core. Why do they need to do this?"

"I need to make some calls. The oxygen supply in the hospital is very low, and we ran out of medicine supplies in the night itself. I don't know when will they remember that the hospitals need help too.", he said as he found himself in a helpless situation.

"Don't worry! Things will get better. You make the calls, I will be here.", as she offered her share of assurance.

As he called up the officials in the health ministry, his wife turned the TV on. The Prime Minister was about to address the mourning nation.

"It's a black day for every Indian out there, as for the first time since 1947; the nation is under the laps of terror, on the very eve of Independence Day. We all are mourning over the tremendous loss we had to face in the last 12 hrs, and I, along with 1.3 billion Indians, have been praying for the precious lives of those affected, since yesterday night. I promise to each and every one of you, that I stand with you, today and everyday to come, as we will face this emergency together. The government is trying its best to help the ones injured and the families of the deceased, and I assure you, that I will be there for each one of them in the coming days of hardship and grief. The helpline numbers are already active, as we are here for you in all possible ways.

But yesterday's incident has made me realize, that only an assurance and support won't heal our nation this time. The root of patriotism has weakened over the years. We have forgotten the cost of our independence. We have forgotten our 200 years of slavery, and thus we are weeping for our nation, only after being struck by terror. We need to wake up to the alarming situation our country faces, and I promise you that the terrorists won't be spared any more. The nations causing the terror won't be welcomed anymore, and we will not settle with peace until and unless we can grieve over our loss with the blood of those causing it. The nation needs you, so be there for the nation from this day, until the last day you breathe on this mother land. Jai Hind.

The Prime Minister's speech had ended, but there was no end to Rajeev's concerns. Most of the calls he made fell into deaf ears, as everybody were busy with the Independence Day developments.

"ALL FAKE PROMISES FOR A WORTHY SPEECH. THEY ARE NOT EVEN BOTHERING TO SUPPLY US WITH THE NEEDFUL. CAN'T THEY TRULY STAND UP TO THEIR NATION, EVEN ON THE VERY INDEPENDENCE DAY?", he almost shouted.

"Calm down Rajeev. Shouting and screaming won't make anything better. You know the way to deal with the situation. Either make them listen to your demand, or raise your voice enough to be heard.", as she stood up to support him in her little way.

He knew what to do. He tried calling the health ministry once again, but it was of no use. He then mailed their demands officially and then went back to his colleagues in the private hospitals who could help them in the situation. Meanwhile, the media came to know about the deficit supplies in the hospitals as complaints were being made from other government setups as well. People were slowly knowing the grim situations the healthcare setup was facing internally and how negligent the government continued to be in the entire ordeal. India was finally waking up, but at a cost, too high, for humanity to afford.

The emergency was over. After continued efforts from the Police, defence and healthcare institutions, the situation has been finally brought under control. Everybody worked at a stretch for 72 hours, to cope up with the root of terror planted in the very core of the capital. The suffering has been huge as 252 people lost their lives.

But there's a smile in the doctor's face today. He knew that 90% of the patients, who were brought to the hospitals, have been saved by the extraordinary efforts of each and every contributing member. Over the last 3 days, he has been the radical change Delhi needed, at its worst. He has taken active efforts to make all the hospitals in the capital work together, barring its differences. He has gone beyond his position and several government laws, only to give the fastest possible treatment to his patients. Now, as he makes his way down to the cabin, he knew that whatever waits for him, he has done everything possible within his capabilities.

He opened the door to his cabin and found a brown envelope on his desk. There was an official letter inside, from the director of the institute, stating that he has been officially sacked from his position.

He smiled with a joy of satisfaction in his heart, as he stepped into the world of peace, for he knew he had already paid his due debt to the war.

"Are you absolutely confident that this information is reliable?" said the tensed director. He tackled many alarming situations in his career, but his face has never revealed this shade of disappointment till date.

"Yes sir. The transaction was made a month earlier, by one of the bureaucrats, near Uttarkashi. It was a small local political group, given strict instructions and blueprint of the plan. The entire meeting was marked as a random business deal in the area, for natural gas, so that nobody would even doubt the background of the meet. The entire data is right in front of you." as Arvind tried his best to show the reality of the situation to the director.

"But do you understand what this implicates Arvind? And I don't understand why the ruling party will ever do something like that."

"Sir, I do know the consequences of this information, and with due respect sir, I thought you would understand better, why they wanted to do this. We are stepping into the 71st year of our independence, and people have forgotten the very roots of patriotism. They only way to make them feel the nationalist sentiments again, is to push them to a point where they will be terrorized to live in their own land. They wanted people to face the worst on the very night of Independence Day, so that they can make themselves heard, so that people understand how dependent they are in the party that is ruling at the centre, for they made sure that only they had the solutions to the trauma people felt. Its simple, similar to what the British taught us, terrorize and rule. 17 minutes of terror, to make 71st independence day count, in every Indian's life." Arvind knew what the government did, and he knew; only they had the power to overturn the entire situation.

"And that's the reason they sacked the poor doctor", said the man sitting behind the desk, his face revealing anguish.

" What a marvelous job he did. He was the only one who was enlightened enough to see the situation through. I wonder when the people of this nation will be truly independent. Arvind, burn this information to ashes, in the incinerator. Whatever you just told me should not reach another soul, if we wish to survive in this bureau. I respect you for the wonderful work you did, but I am afraid that this secret should go with us, to our graves. Afterall, none of us, in this nation have the actual freedom we need to lead our lives with head held high."

The director couldn't stand up from his chair, to bid Arvind a final farewell, for he has never been chained to his position, as badly as he was today.

"Freedom?" he smirked, as he lit a cigarette and exhaled the haunting memories of yet another episode of corruption, in a cloud of smoke.
