First, there were a few materials, which was then made into a even solid material, as solid as the materialistic dreams of the masses, this small comment will not affect you unless you both belong and not belong to the masses, whatever, moving back, this solid material then changed into a building, and was named as a shopping mall, and how the chief builder smiled at his greatest creation, here we should smile along with him because all smiles are short lived and we must grab every opportunity to smile. The builder, however went back home with an extreme thought, here ladies and gentlemen let me remind you that all true thoughts are born as extreme thoughts, however reading the previous lines, I can see a few pessimistic readers raring to find fault with me, to them I say, “Calm down”, that extreme thought was in itself an extremity of my imagination, moving on.

The builder was thinking to himself, what if one day, his greatest creation through the ravages of time, broke down and killed people, a lot of them, which also happens every day, when with each passing moment a lot of people do indeed die, however the fuss is only created when a lot of people die within a given boundary, or to be more specific, when people die at the same place. A death of an individual only affects the greater masses, when he belongs to a greater class, and in some exception, belonging to the lower classes, but, we have moved too far ahead with our ideas, lets go back to the builder who is anxiously waiting for us to hear his rather demoralising thoughts, as if whatever we have spoken isn't demoralising enough. The builder knew that he wouldn't be at fault, if the building broke down after a few decades, with Senor Time taking the blame, as he has done time and time again, but what if it broke down just after a few years, the builder would be the one who would be blamed, then I must say Mr Destiny has done a great favour to our favourite Senor Time, who must be heaving a sigh of relief. As with all human beings, we like to think about the road ahead of us, and this builder was thinking about that rather gloomy road, a road which might have been gloomy for him, but deliciously pleasing for the officer investigating him, who would love to extract the truth from that plant of lies that the builder would have possessed by then.

The conversation between the officer and the builder would begin like any normal conversation, What is your name, actually it doesn't matter, why were you running, I was afraid of getting arrested, Aren't you afraid, you've been arrested now, Yes I am, Do you know what you have done, No sir, Your faulty construction plan caused a portion of the building to collapse, I never meant to do it, Just because you never meant to do it doesn't mean you are not guilty, I know I am guilty, guilty of ignorance, ignorance is a hard term to ignore, I can do nothing but smile at that, So, are you ready to confess your sins, Are you a priest, You don't get to joke today, I was not joking, I am no saint, But I asked whether you were a priest, Shut up, they are both the same, Maybe, So, do you accept  your fault in the collapse of the building, Yes I do, That eases my job, What do you think will happen to me, Maybe life imprisonment maybe death but that's good, you don't have to be part of this deliciously strange world, Now, who's turning philosopher, Life makes most of us a philosopher somewhere down the road, Why not up the road, Life is always a descent.

We shall now forget about the builder, who too shall bury his fear with help from Ignorance, oh never mind the absence of a mister or senor before his name, he is just fraught with ignorance. A beautiful lady somewhere across the city is demanding our attention, rather her beauty is demanding our attention, yet I warn you, her story is a bit sad, as if all our stories are happy. Dreams, dreams and dreams, where would be without them, what would we be without them, we will be in our houses, with a clearly non-dreamy job. Ah the lady! She fell in love with a mathematics scholar, married him, and soon after that our genius started developing mental problems. Now, men reading those lines out of context, would laugh and come to the common conclusion that women, oh they are all the problems, yet women reading those lines in the same manner would see the truth and sympathize with this young lady, and for not the first time, we have to agree with them, but there, there no offence to the men.

Our young lady tried everything, but our genius loved his maths more than his wife, which is so very normal, that was funny, seeing your deadpan faces, I assume pretty confidently that it wasn't funny, er, yes, our young lady, she is so alone now-a-days, her in-laws try their best to not make her feel alone, yet we all can understand the difference in ages, her only respite being the popular social networking sites, in a story in this day and age, although there is only a quite large difference between these two, I know some of you were wondering when would social networking sites be mentioned, moving on, that was the young lady's only respite, oh we have done this part, so day after day she would be engulfed in these things, but don't think she wasn't caring for her husband, relatives and neighbours would pester her with questions about her often missing husband in various social functions, apologies everyone, correction required, her always missing husband, but, people evolve, and soon questions stopped, and empathy towards her grew, which again would be a blessing or an insult to a person, depending on the degree of the person's self-respect, or as sociologists, beautiful people they are, would say the degree of the person's societal respect, pardon me if I am wrong, but I don't think sociologists would say that really, I was just trying to show off my knowledge, as if no one does it.

And sometimes to escape the reality of this deliciously strange world, as our imaginary officer mentioned earlier, she would go to watch movies at the multiplex of that same shopping mall, which you would more likely remember as our builder's worst nightmare, because human beings tend to remember the bad things more efficiently, now reading that some might marvel at my sense of observation, while others might think this is such an orthodox observation, and I am not going to be the god of truth to tell which one of these later observation's subject is correct. And so one fine day, this young and beautiful lady went to see a movie in the aforementioned multiplex at the many-more-times mentioned shopping mall.

Now, let’s through the magnifying glasses of a small power, look at a young boy, about seventeen, I couldn't mention the age of the lady for reasons not unknown, who was walking into the same shopping mall to catch, not literally, the same movie on the same day, with a friend. Seeing that smirk on that man's face, let me tell you, things here work a little differently, this young boy was dark enough not to have a girlfriend, he was here with just a friend, who was white enough to have one, but Monsieur Luck was not smiling at him, yet. Now our black young man, was born to parents who were fair enough, but genes, they could be tough customers sometimes, anyways, he grew up being the odd one in his family, although he had the attitude of not caring about his colour, his mom knew how much it affected him. Plus, his whiter friends would call him nigger, apologies for using such a crude and popular term, which further shows how human beings love getting offensive, yet being offended depends on the person who is called nigger, this is a bad argument, moving on, our young black boy loved movies and would often dream about making a few someday, and it was his love of movies that brought him to the shopping mall.

The reason was the same for our young white boy as well. Although he would never refrain from making crude jokes about his friend being a nigger, he was a good friend. Yet, his reasons for loving movies were different. His parents were never on good terms and they would always fight, and as psychologists would say, this can affect the child, as if nothing else would affect a child, how idiotic, anyways, our young white boy wanted his parents to be together, in fact one of his earliest memories were that of being in court for his parents’ divorce, yet somehow that divorce didn't happen, but what did happen was the death of his father a few months later, after being attacked by workers in the factory where he was the manager, but wait for it, these workers belonged to the darker race, as if his father belonged to a white race, but we cannot tell that for sure, and from this incident came his hatred for niggers, it was a well-documented hatred I must say, since everyone spoke about it both in front of him and behind his back, and he knew it as well. Oh, I almost forgot, his love for movies. After his father died his mother had a hard time understanding reality, what a bad expression, how can time be hard or soft, and our young white boy was the one who would always take care of her, but the body, although a home of miraculous feats, needs its rest, independence, autonomy in its functioning, and in this case our white boy needed the rest from stress, an old literature teacher seeing that last phrase may analyse, You see students, there is a hint of para-rhyme, a break in the music, but without meaning any disrespect to this old English teacher, all music always breaks. What were we talking about, ah yes, the white boy, young white boy, I forgot to mention that, and his ways of relieving stress, a student in our country might write, the ways of relieving stress are as follows, pornographic videos, which always lead to masturbation, and movies. Both of them are tried and tested ways, and our white boy would personally guarantee that they work, especially the first one. There, I can see the men smiling silently and yes, a few women are smiling too. So, our white boy, had come with his friend, the black boy, to watch a good movie and relieve some stress.

Phew, that was a long paragraph, but I can't guarantee that this won't be that long, but like a good salesman I never mentioned the definition of long, yes madam, what I meant to say was that this paragraph won't be as long as the time which has passed since our next character, mind you, I deliberately did not use person, because who are we except for different characters, moving on, since our next character had cried for the first time and felt the most humiliated being in this world, but ah sad child, she was a small kid then, how much do we know about the mosts and leasts in the world, don't worry even I don't, although I may have the outlook of an all-knowing observer, but now the sad child is grown up into a fiery teacher, who everyone hates and respects, although that sounds weirdly ambiguous, as does so many things these days, it will sound less so as I explain the circumstances which rule this situation. Firstly, most of her students hated her and thought that she was the devil herself, or himself, choosing the gender depends on whether you are a feminist or not, while some did hate her, they also respected  her, well not her but her powers, because she, as many of us will nod with that all-knowing expression, had a lot of connections, oh even that small boy smiling there knows about these connections, how quickly times have changed, it was not very long ago that these connections were chased by the police, and now even the police are part of it, no, don't take it as a disappointment, it is the evolution of human beings.

Yes, yes, I will get on with our fiery teacher, her colleagues thought she was crazy, yet they knew she was the best, and of course showed admiration and respect towards her, but whether it was feigned or not, that I do not know, come on its not possible for me to know everything, yet, why was I even talking about this fiery teacher in the first place, oh, I remember, the chain of changes, here the English teacher arrives again, Students please duly note, there is a strong example of alliteration in the last phrase which the author uses, the English teachers, I pity them, they give their lives to English, and the only thing they get in return is a line or two, to be written on epitaphs of their graves, and this goes for all language teachers, so I am not biased towards only English teachers, like that survival strategist who is always biased towards three political parties and a mental asylum as the solution of all problems, again and again I am moving from the main course, the teacher when she was a fiery girl, well that's for the next paragraph, though this one is not very big yet.

The teacher had always been a good student, unlike many other teachers, some would say she was a brilliant student, so one day she was told of a surprise test to be taken later that day in school, she got caught up in some classes and couldn't prepare, while her friends prepared as much as they could after managing a few free periods, yet it was our teacher who topped the test, and what did her friends tell her, that she knew about the test and had actually cheated, now to a true teacher, that would be offending, and although our teacher had not yet become the teacher, she most certainly felt humiliated and offended, and she cried, and then never told anybody about this day, but she would always do something fun on this day after that to ease her humiliation, for humiliation can never be eased, how she did it one can only speculate about. So, this time on this day she decided to watch a movie in that same shopping mall, actually the same movie with the same timings, some would say a coincidence, but coincidences are always occurring, those that we cannot see are the ones which are too shy to show themselves, Yes sir, what do you want to know, ah yes, which subject did the teacher topped that test, you are a very good yet a bad observer, what did you think it would be after all that talk about English, of course, it was English.

And here they are, all of them, standing in the queue to enter the movie hall, I have always wondered how looming these movie halls are, like the halls of Tartarus, you can take this as a premonition of what is to come, here, here, where is our young black boy going, he doesn't like lines, if you know what I mean, so he is going out of the line to get some air, remember our teacher, she is in her mid-fifties, and the beautiful young lady, who, for the sake of the younger inquisitive minds, is in her mid-twenties, they are at the back of the line, this must be a good movie, the line is a long one.

And then suddenly, or as I explained earlier, in a visual coincidence of all the forces affecting it, the roof of the hall and its surrounding portion crumbled, or to put more simply, it just fell, the first casualties were the first ones in the line, and then people started crumbling or screaming like the way a domino works, our young boy saw his friend the white boy disappear, and while he tried to run, he bid his friend a silent farewell, its curious how the human mind works when faced with death, the farewell ironical, because seconds later he himself had to bid farewell to the bone and flesh world, to maybe enter another world of bone and flesh or something else, as far as our two ladies are concerned, we have to bid both of them farewell as well, why are you so angry at me young man, what can I do if the young woman dies, beautiful she maybe, but beautiful women have died a lot throughout history, and young men have been angry, so why blame the narrator, anyways, let’s see the official count of the dead, its 113 they say, as they always say, but now ladies and gentlemen, we have to enter the room of consequences.

The builder's worst nightmare came through, but don't think that the path that we set out for him at the beginning, when the builder had thought about this outcome, but, as I used this same word a few moments ago, and seeing which our deceased teacher might have said that my English is bad due to the repetition of the same word in such close proximity, yet life is itself a repetition in an even more close proximity, hell, where were we, the builder, The builder committed suicide as if he was wanting to apologise to the deceased in person, okay bad joke, no, he was afraid of having been shamed in public, considering that decision we might say that the intelligence of the builder should really be called into question, people condemned with posts on social networking sites, such as RIP so and so We will miss you bro or sis or love or friend or so many other calling devices , now since the italics are over we must have something new to say, which is indeed true, the commemorations poured in and the mass's heartache were multiplied by a sad dithyramb from the minister of state, this leads me to scrutinize my paradoxes because dithyrambs can almost never be sad, anyways moving on, families grieved, relatives cried, acquaintances felt sorry, lovers mortified, colleagues sad, yet somewhere happy, and there is no shame in saying this, as now no one could stop their own promotions, even our teacher's students, they too grieved, but somewhere deep down they felt relieved about the menace that was gone, and lets move our attention to the mad mathematician, who has lost his wife, for him a constant had been eliminated from his equation of life, but if one constant goes another comes, especially if the variables included consists of money, but hush, hush, no one should dare ask about what happened to our young white boy's mother.

There were candles lit in honour of them, the deceased, there were walks arranged for them, however to the always reprimanded part of the society, it was a happy sight, their lords were leading their lives, even if it was only during a simple walk, and in one of these walks, there were a group of sociologists, here they pop up again, who came to the common consensus that the families were only grieving because they had lost their investments and with them their incentives, it is the human ones they mean, for there is no such thing called love, if any one of them decide to write a paper on it, young and aspiring sociologists don't be surprised to read this as your college texts in the future, and of course people flocked to the site of the destruction to pay their never-ending homage, and to click a few selfies as well, and then there was this news, which was broadcast wherever the signals would go.

It was at this opportune moment, a couple in some obscure little place, but bear in mind, that the entire world is obscure, this couple heard the news on the radio. For some days they heard the same news, and the more impatient husband got tired, It’s the same words with which the news is made of, he raged, they could have at least changed the words, on hearing this, the more wiser wife, an expression common since the time of Macbeth, said to her beloved husband, All news are words but all words are not news, while you think about that, let me tell you something as a parting gift, something which wise men over the years have told in all possible manners, though it is something even the fools can tell, All stories are words yet all words are not stories.
