Death is a guest, who makes it a point to visit everyone. Death is strange. Death is perplexing. Death is mysterious.
Death is a guest. Sometimes, Death is a good guest who comes only after being invited. Death discusses the terms. We add a few more. Death complies, sometimes doesn't.  We leave in peace.
Death is a guest. Sometimes, Death is a bad guest who comes uninvited. Most of us let Death through because of the fear. Death laps up the fear and takes us before we can finish the unfinished stories, before we can start the new beginnings. Yet, some of us don't let Death go through that easy. We fight with Death.  We become bloody. We still fight. We become weary. We still fight. We become exhausted. We still fight. Here too, we lose most of the time. Death is too strong. But, there are times when Death is tired. Death allows us to win.  We are glorified for defeating Death. We know we won the battle. We also know that Death will return. This time perhaps as a good guest. Or maybe, Death will return full of vengeance. Death can lose the battle, but Death will always win the war.
Death is a guest. Sometimes, Death is a friend who comes to cheer us up. Death does that willingly on occasions and rather reluctantly otherwise. There are times when Death has to be called. There are times when Death reads our minds and rescues us without complain. There are times when Death becomes the counselor and teaches us to not take Life for granted. Life is Death's best friend and worst enemy. There are times when Death cannot stand the cruelty of Life. There are times when Death cannot stand its kindness. Death always intervenes. Sometimes,  when Life just starts to gain a new follower or sometimes, when Life doesn't need the follower any more.
Death isn't even a guest on instances. Death is a thief who comes whenever the ornaments of Life are in excess. Death steals from us with the help of guns and explosions and knives and missiles. Death is on a rampage then. Death doesn't care about the things taught by the teacher who goes by the name Humanity. Death has lust in the eyes. Lust for Life. So, Death devours Life irrespective of where we are, what we look like or what we believe in. Death needs to satiate its lust. The old teacher Humanity eventually shouts some sense into Death, but this lust can never be cured. Time offers its healing prowess and Humanity accepts. Death then goes on a sabbatical, albeit a short one.
Death and Justice consequently meet on a circular road, where Death is the reason we look for Justice and Justice is the reason we look for Death. Death is the crime and Death is the cure.
Death does nothing but smiles at all this. Deaths knows that in the end, no matter what happens, Death will always win.
