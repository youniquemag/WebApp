The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, situated on the second floor of Quest Mall, Syed Amir Ali Avenue, right opposite to the Adidas outlet, is the city's favourite place to devour on coffee. The cafe is designed to be a very cozy, and the comfortable seating adds on to the relaxing ambience.
They serve coffee, and may conventionally have higher price tags, but they never compromise with the quality, and is worth it. The Hazelnut Latte is one of the much talked about beverage, along with an array of others like the Hot chocolate, Cappuccino and the Vanilla flavoured coffee.
The cafe serves delicious pastries; some to definitely try for are the Blueberry Cheesecakes, which they make the best, among others there is Cheery Mousse Cake and the Chocolate Mud Pie, also Boston Nut Brownie. They serve delicious muffins and croissants too.
The attendants are very courteous and the atmosphere is warm. The decor is something to be called as brilliant, almost a perfect place to spend a splendid and friendly evening.
