Santa Coming By

As the homeless creatures drag along
With a thing called 'brother' in her arms
At home – In streets – On Christmas
-	Where they belong
The brother’s warm…safe arms
Cozy as he is…free from all hairs
The bells jingle!
Singles mingle!
The warmth of fire!
The youth in desire…!
But how do we pen –
-	A pest put to test?
An object of pity,
The very lyrics to the test.
The stomach squeaks
The brother weeps
But the stupid girl
In her arrogant dreams
Where logic lies
But hope still breathes
When ‘passer-by’-s just pass by,
The stupid creature
Sees Santa Coming By
