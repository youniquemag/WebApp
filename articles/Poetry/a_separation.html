Separated by birth,
A distance dictated by social norms.
But when two hearts align ,
Fate shall break all barriers.

I Held her hand, to escape civilization,
Only for her to be outcasted as a witch.
While I remain bewitched by her beauty,
She only held on to her prayers.

Tears rolled down their cheeks,
For the long lost soul.
Held their arms wide open,
To take her back into their arms.

Civilization accepted the bitter truth,
And a union was made.
"It's to last over an eternity" was the cry,
Only it echoed with no response in return.

A child born out of passion,
Filled the crack with happiness.
A sight so pure and serene,
Healed all the scars which were made.

Years passed,only blank faces to each other,
Simply,following the way of the world.
Dreams were shattered,
And the world around broken.


The eutony of the child's words,
The only source of pleasantry.
And soon innocence was to be lost,
As truth slowly beckoned to her.

A world broken into two,
She remain transfixed in between.
Hoping to unite the two,
But the two pieces were beyond repair.

Her mind poisoned by humankind,
The fire of her age ignited.
Drawing out her rebellious nature,
Casting out her voice.

Left demeaned by her age,
Her words were left unheeded.
She could only view the world,
With blurred vision hoping to seek solace.

Happiness,was a forgotten art,
She succumbed to the pain.
Left with nothing but despair,
She finally chose to give it all away.

The two pieces were united in loss,
Epiphany made its toll.
A lost art was revived,
Which could be seen through the gates of heaven.
