Kiss

Kissed your butt … Ah! Such pleasure!
Stubbed, stamped, burned out…
May be anger, love or leisure.
A cuppa for my hand on the left,
You are my right hand man!
I will burn you down…
… and pick up one again.

I don’t know if it’s your tale or mine
A tale to tell and so of time
Twin, may be, you are to me?
May be we are one…
Consuming each other…
… Till death do us part.
