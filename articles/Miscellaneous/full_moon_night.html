It was another night . A calm, peaceful , soothing night unlike the other harsh, painful, cruel nights. She hopped down from her bed and went near the window. Opening the window sill, as silently as possible she looked up. Slowly she turned back and looked at the door. She stared at it for a while . Consoling her restless mind she again glanced outside. The tranquilized wind was moving the trees to and fro, but gently . This time it seemed like these trees made the black shadows in the sky. The twinkling stars were now quiet. The lake didnt make whirlpools now. As if everything just stopped for a moment to appreciate the beauty of the enthralling moon rising from behind the shadows. She always thought the marks on the moon to be its birthmarks. How beautiful they were. Soon her eyes caught the flying white crane and once more she envied its freedom. Not a single sound but the stridulating of the cricket. The silvery glow of the moon and the myriad of golden fireflies merged to create a sensation. She kept looking for her peace amidst all of these but somehow she couldnt. Once again she looked at the door . The serene scene made her feel untroubled and composed, yet something kept her alert. It has been years that she witnessed such a beautiful night. She thought today's night might be special. What if she considered todays date as her birthday? It was soothing. She always longed to experience one such free night. And just then the door banged open.  

"Brothel isn't a place to experience peace", she thought undressing herself.
