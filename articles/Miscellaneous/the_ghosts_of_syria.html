Bashar Hafez al-Assad, the 19th and current president of Syria, is not just a king of red sands and dead men, women and children. His dominion the near equivalent of a mass grave, he is a prominent war criminal standing amidst the ranks of Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein, Joseph Stalin, and Hitler. Today the government of Syria stands out as an epitome of oppression
The 15th of March, 2018, will mark the 8th year of the continuing Civil War in Syria. Eight years ago, two successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, collectively known as the Arab Spring, where the presidents of both countries were toppled. This gave hope to the Syrian nationals, vastly comprised of Muslims belonging to the Sunni sect, who wished to overthrow their harsh government in favour of a democratic and more liberal one. Al-Assad’s Presidential election, where his campaign acquired an 88.7% of national votes, has already been labelled a sham by several of Syria’s former allies, but this man’s tyranny was only not limited to political crimes like rigging an election campaign. When 15 young boys were detained and tortured in Syria, a 13 year old amongst them was beaten to death, for writing graffiti in support of the Arab Spring. This lead to a burst of peaceful protests on the March of 2011, by Syrian pro-democratic activists all over the country. Bashar al-Assad murdered and imprisoned protesters without a thought. While most of Syria’s population comprises of Sunni Muslims, the government and the security establishment of Syria is largely comprised by a small and privileged portion called the Alawi-sect. The atrocities committed against ordinary civilians and long standing racial/religious favouritism led to the formation of the Free Syrian Army, comprised of civilians who have suffered at the hands of the al-Assad government and several defectors from the military.
The Syrian civil war has led to mass genocide under the direction of Bashar al-Assad. But he is not merely some rabid dog. He is an educated adversary, a doctor specialising in ophthalmology, who abandoned his Hippocratic oath long ago and committed himself to the service of notions dictated by an orthodox and merciless culture. This madness of an idiot with too much power and an army to command has led to the murder of brave patriots, innocent civilians, children and infants. In spite of this, there are nations that have yet to remove their blinders and see things clearly, people who still hold on to their expired notions of religious dominion, whilst there are other still seeking profit in death, attempting to manipulate a heart rending situation for advantage. Iran and Iraq, and Lebanon-based Hezbollah, whose governments comprise mostly of the Shia and Alawi sects of Islam combine their forces to aid al-Assad in the slaughter, simply because in their diseased brains they do not see human beings being cut down to pieces but only Sunnis. China and Russia stand with al-Assad’s regime simply to undermine The U.S.’s attempts at controlling the situation and minimising civilian casualties. Although Russia has taken a more active role in funding the madman’s campaign and bombing the rebels and civilians as though it is open season for them.  
The U.S. is however not alone in its efforts to bring order and end the rule of tyranny in Syria, for Israel, Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia has joined in the find. However, one might question their motives since these countries, in the sectors of government and armed forces and in general population, are dominated by the Sunni Sect. Whilst the rebels of the Free Syrian Army must loot or steal their resources, the ordinary civilians have taken a neutral stance and are counting their days and thanking their God every morning. They are in constant fear of being bombed or set on fire, and they are denied access to the most basic necessities like food, water, clothing and medical supplies simply because the president dabbles on the occasional sadism when he is not ordering the butchery of young boys and girls for having different opinions. The Mercy Corp has so far played an invaluable role in rehabilitating and rescuing many of the helpless stuck in Syria who has lost all their family along with everything that they ever owned. The first world war, the “war to end all wars” which ended nothing, yielded the Lost Generation, the veterans and the martyrs. The Syrian Civil War has yielded its body count that is rising beyond 4,65,000 and its refugees, the Ghosts of Syria, the sad evicted people have become memories without homes.
