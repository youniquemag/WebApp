Most foodies tend to wrinkle their nose at the mention of vegetarian food. However, being one of the nearest eateries to my college and affordable if regular visits are to be made, there was no way I could turn my back on Ridhi Sidhi.
Located beside Emami Market on Lord Sinha Road, this vegetarian restaurant gives a homely feeling with its quiet ambience and a décor that is neither too posh nor too flashy. One can pick from a wide range of items. Starting out from a cave of breads and buns, it delves deep into Chinese and South Indian, grabbing huge chunks of fast foods in between, it finally emerges with a plethora of desserts and beverages as diverse as a rainbow. 
Frankie Cheese Roll, Singapore Noodles, Hot Brownie Sundae and Soda Shikanji top my chart of most frequently ordered items that tend to linger on the taste buds. There are a few other dishes, however, like Regular Pav Bhaji and Papdi Chat that are only mediocre. Regardless of the fact that the staff is cooperative, some items take rather long to come prepared.
If you are looking forward to some experimenting with vegetarian items in a more or less cordial atmosphere, Ridhi Sidhi is your place.
